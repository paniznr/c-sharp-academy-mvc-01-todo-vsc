# To Do List Application using ASP.NET, C#, MVC, SQL
In this project, I learned how to create a To Do List application using ASP.NET, C#, SQL and the MVC design pattern. The initial application I learned to make (using C Sharp Academy's tutorial) could create, read, update and delete To Do items on the list. However, I added more functionality by implementing a "Sort by Name" option, which really helped me dive deeper into the app and understand it deeply.
For instance, I learned:
- To implement a separate sorting function (by adding "ORDER BY" to my query)
- To use said function only if the Sort by Name button has been clicked at some point (by using a form-action in the .cshtml to trigger, and Sessions)
- To successfully stay in the sorted state and update to a properly sorted list even when adding new items, updating items and deleting items 
- To style my site slightly differently (different background image that properly fits the screen, different buttons)
